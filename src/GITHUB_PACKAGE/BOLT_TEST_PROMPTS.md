## üêõ Debug Test Prompts

### If Staff Dropdown is Empty:
```
The staff dropdown is showing empty. Open browser console and run these commands, then tell me the output:

debugHelper.showStaff()
debugHelper.checkHealth()

Based on the output, fix the issue. The problem is usually:
1. Users not initialized properly
2. getAllStaff() function not finding staff role
3. LocalStorage corrupted

Fix it so that 5 staff members appear in the dropdown.
```

### If Demo Data is Missing:
```
Demo data is not showing. Please:

1. Check if initializeDemoData() is being called in App.tsx
2. Verify localStorage has the demo data key
3. Check browser console for any initialization errors
4. Add console logs to debug the demo data creation

Fix the issue so that when the app loads for the first time, it automatically creates:
- 5 advances (one for each staff)
- 8 demo expenses across different categories
```

### If Login Fails:
```
Login is not working. Check:

1. Is signInWithEmail() function being called correctly?
2. Are user credentials being checked properly?
3. Is localStorage being set for current user?
4. Are there any console errors?

The default admin credentials should be:
- Email: admin@mkmarketing.com
- Password: admin123

Fix the authentication to work with these credentials.
```
