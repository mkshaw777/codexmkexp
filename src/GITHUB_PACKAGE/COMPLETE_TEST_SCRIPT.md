## üêõ Debug Test: If Something Breaks

```
If you encounter any issues:

2. Run these commands and report results:

// Check system health
debugHelper.checkHealth()

// Show all users
debugHelper.showUsers()

// Show only staff
debugHelper.showStaff()

Based on the output:

If users are missing or corrupted:
debugHelper.fix()

If staff dropdown is empty but users exist:
- Check getAllStaff() function in lib/data.ts
- Verify role filter works correctly
- Make sure 'staff' role is lowercase

If demo data is missing:
- Check if initializeDemoData() runs in App.tsx
